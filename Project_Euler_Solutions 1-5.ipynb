The largest number in the list will be our largest divisor.... however this largest divisor may not be prime!!!  \n",

For example if a number is divisible by 8 it will also be divisible by 2 and 4, so we can divide out by these common denominators.  By working our way from 20 down to 1 we can generate this number by adding a multiple to the solution of any prime factors not already included in the product.  In order to do this we can use our prime factorization code from problem 3 in order to generate factor sets, and then add any non-shared prime factors to a solution factors list.
