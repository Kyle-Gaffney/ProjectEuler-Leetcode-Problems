# ProjectEuler-Leetcode-Solutions
Collection of solutions to ProjectEuler and Leetcode problems in python.

Python Codes generating solutions are of the form PEx.py  where x is the project euler problem number.  For example PE53.py will be a solution to project euler problem 53.

Additionally there are some Jupyter Notebook tutorials of how the solutions were achieved with annotated python codes.  These files are of the form x.ipynb
